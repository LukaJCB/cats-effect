 *  - JavaScript's
 *    [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout setTimeout]].
 *
 * It provides:
 *
 *  1. the ability to get the current time
 *  1. thread / call-stack shifting
 *  1. ability to delay the execution of a task with a specified time duration
 *
 * It does all of that in an `F` monadic context that can suspend
 * side effects and is capable of asynchronous execution (e.g. [[IO]]).
 *
 * This is NOT a type class, as it does not have the coherence
 * requirement.

   * runtime (e.g. Node.js) it might return multiples of 10
   * milliseconds or more.
   *

   *
   * The returned value can have nanoseconds resolution and represents
   * the number of time units elapsed since some fixed but arbitrary
   * origin time. Usually this is the Unix epoch, but that's not
   * a guarantee, as due to the limits of `Long` this will overflow in
   * the future (2^63^ is about 292 years in nanoseconds) and the
   * implementation reserves the right to change the origin.
   *
   * The return value should not be considered related to wall-clock
   * time, the primary use-case being to take time measurements and
   * compute differences between such values, for example in order to
   * measure the time it took to execute a task.
   *
   * As a matter of implementation detail, the default `Timer[IO]`
   * implementation uses `System.nanoTime` and the JVM will use
   * `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` when available, instead of `CLOCK_REALTIME`
   * (see `clock_gettime()` on Linux) and it is up to the underlying
   * platform to implement it correctly.
   *
   * And be warned, there are platforms that don't have a correct
   * implementation of `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`. For example at the moment of
   * writing there is no standard way for such a clock on top of
   * JavaScript and the situation isn't so clear cut for the JVM
   * either, see:
   *
   *  - [[https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6458294 bug report]]
   *  - [[http://cs.oswego.edu/pipermail/concurrency-interest/2012-January/008793.html concurrency-interest]]
   *    discussion on the X86 tsc register
   *
   * The JVM tries to do the right thing and at worst the resolution
   * and behavior will be that of `System.currentTimeMillis`.
   *
   * The recommendation is to use this monotonic clock when doing
   * measurements of execution time, or if you value monotonically
   * increasing values more than a correspondence to wall-time, or
   * otherwise prefer [[clockRealTime]].
